# Tallon and the Meanies

The aim of this project was to implement some sort of AI technique to escape and evade the meanies while avoiding pits and collecting bonuses. 

I deceived to try my hand at Q-Learning and the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm. More can be read about these here:

## Videos of Attempts

### Scoring 40 points



### Evading the Meanies once all bonuses have been collected



### Meanies covering the last bonus so my Q-Learning has no where to plot a path to :(
